# Subdags
* The main DAG manages all the subDAGs as normal tasks
* Airflow UI only shows the main DAG.
* SubDags must be scheduled the same as their parent DAG
* Use SubDags with caution
* How to create SubDag?
    - Create factory method that returns a DAG object with the tasks we want to combine
*** when a SubDagOperator is triggered, it takes a worker slot and each task in the child DAG takes a slot as well until the entire SubDAG is finished
    --> One way to avoid deadlocks is by creating a queue only for SubDags
